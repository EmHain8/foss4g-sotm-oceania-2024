# Travel Grant Program #
The Travel Grant Program (TGP) is aimed at increasing the diversity, impact, and reach of the conference. We are looking for worthy recipients who are committed to make an impact with the opportunity provided, and we want to stretch our limited budget as widely as possible.

The TGP is administered by the Conference Committee (CC) and supported by OSGeo Oceania.
